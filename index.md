# This is a markup tutorial  
## I am following this tutorial from Github  
Here is a link to the tutorial [Github Markup]  (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links) 

## The goal is to write a static webpage without using HTML  
    
Basic headings are written with  
```
Each # symbol corresponds to a heading level, this would be h1  
and this ## would be h2 and so on  
```
