# This is a markup tutorial  
## I am following this tutorial from Github  
Here is a link to the tutorial [Github Markup](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)  

## The goal is to write a static webpage without using HTML  
    
Basic headings are written with:  
```
Each # symbol corresponds to a heading level, this would be <h1></h1> 
and this ## would be <h2></h2> and so on.  
This text is inside a code quoting box, this is used by typing ` three times before and after the content.
```
  
There are multiple ways to enhance text, **here is bold**, *here is italic*, ~~here is strikethrough~~, **_here is bold and " nested "italic_**, ***here is all bold and italic***, <sub>this is subcsript text</sub>, <sup>this is superscript</sup>.  

```
These stylings as in order of appearance:  
** ** 
* *  
~~ ~~  
**_ _**  
*** ***  
<sub> </sub>  
<sup> </sup>  
The empty space between is for your text content.
```
  
> This is a quote.  
You can also `quote`in the middle of a sentence.

Colours are achieved using the \`rgb(R,G,B)\` for example. HEX and HSL is also supported. Here is a randomly picked colour `rgb(9, 105, 218)`

- This is a list line began with -
* This is a list line began with * 
+ This is a list line began with +

1. Number and a dot creates an ordered list  
2. Like so  
3. and like so  
  
* This is a nested list  
         - here is a nested list item  
                            - here is an even more nested list item  
  
Here is a task list:
- [ ] This is an uncompleted task
- [x] This is a completed task
- [ ] \(Optional) a task inside parenthesis
  
You can mention github users with the @ symbol.   
@t1rate01 created this project. This mention doesn't do anything here.
  
Well read so far! :+1:  [^1] 

[^1]: That was an emoji by the way, they are supported too. Not in all browsers though. In a github readme file it would work for example [^2] 
[^2]: That was a footnote  
  
<!-- This line is invisible -->
  
There was an invisible line just now. Hidden content is written with: 
``` 
<!-- CONTENT -->
```

I could write that also by just escaping with \   
like this : <\!-- --> or even use \*formatting\* symbols and they'd be ignored.
